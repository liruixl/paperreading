# Single-Shot Object Detection with Enriched Semantics

[Detection with Enriched Semantics(DES)算法笔记](https://blog.csdn.net/u014380165/article/details/80602240)

这篇结构比较简单，但是思想绝不简单。各种解释看得我是云里雾里。比如：

> The feature map generated by the segmentation branch captures high level semantic information for each local area since the segmentation supervision pushes each local area to be assigned to one of the classes.

> Global activation blocks can learn the relationship between channels and object classes, by eliminating the spatial information, in a self-supervised manner .

啥啊这都是。。
